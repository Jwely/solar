class chunk_bundle():
    """
    Creates a chunk bundle object.

    it can be used to pass smaller pieces of information to complex functions
    and reduce memory consumption in those functions.

    Presently, chunks are not saved individually, but are always bundled to form the
    undivided raster image. This allows chunks to be passed individually and sequentially
    through large data processing tasks with each task taking much less memory. Then output
    chunks may be stiched together in a chunk_bundle and saved as a raster image.

    In the future, writing chunks to disk and dropping them from memory may be a good idea
    to truly maximize the data volume that a limited memory space can handle.

    FUTURE WORK NOTE:
    For intended functionality, this module uses a dnppy wrapper of the arcpy.RasterToNumPyArray
    function that passes a numpy array and a metadata object.
    
    This module SHOULD allow users without arcmap to import non-geospatial image data by using a library
    such as python "cv2" for maximum utility.

            2) building new chunk_bundle with processed data, passing on old chunks metadata:
