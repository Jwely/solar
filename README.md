# solar
tiny solar module for handling the variety of calculations that are commonly required 
to make sense of the complex relationship between a point on the earths surface and the sun

For starters, it replicates the functionality of the NOAA calculator found here:
[http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/grad/solcalc/calcdetails.html]

It has recently been updated to allow calculations for all points within a numpy array (lat,lon)

It was produced in my free time as part of a personal project of mine, but clearly has some utility in the dnppy module. 
It is distributed as part of the dnppy module with permission of the original author.
